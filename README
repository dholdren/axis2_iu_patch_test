This project is a set of tests for a patch to Apache Axis2.
It uses JRuby, Test::Unit, Rack (for service mock responses)

Also there's some simple Maven integration for 'require'-ing java libs in your local repo.


To apply the patch:
1) check out Axis2 trunk:
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/axis/axis2/java/core/trunk axis2

2) apply the patch:
cd axis2
patch -p0 -i path/to/thisproject/resources/patches/ui_trunk.patch

3) build axis2 SNAPSHOT (trunk): 
(this will place the compiled jars and dependencies into your local maven rep)
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -DskipTests=true install

4) generate axis2 clients for testing:
(from this project's root)
rake generate_artifacts

5) run the tests:
rake test
