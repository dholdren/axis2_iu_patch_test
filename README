This project is a set of tests for a patch to Apache Axis2.
It uses JRuby, Test::Unit, Rack (for service mock responses)
Also there's some simple Maven integration for 'require'-ing java libs in your local repo.

This project was used to develop the patch via TDD, it has been submitted here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS2-4859
I've included the result in resources/patches/


To test the patch:
1) check out Axis2 in the directory above this one:
  cd ..
a) 1_5 branch:
  svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/axis/axis2/java/core/branches/1_5 axis2_br_1_5
b) trunk:
  svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/axis/axis2/java/core/trunk axis2_trunk

2) apply the patch
a) 1_5 branch (JAR version: 1.5.3-SNAPSHOT)
  cd axis2_br_1_5
  patch -p0 -i ../axis2_iu_patch_test/resources/patches/iu_1_5.patch
b) trunk (JAR version: SNAPSHOT)
  cd axis2_trunk
  patch -p0 -i ../axis2_iu_patch_test/resources/patches/iu_trunk.patch

3) build Axis2 with changes (both versions):
  rake build_axis2

3) generate axis2 clients for testing:
(from this project's root)
a) (with 1.5.3-SNAPSHOT jars - DEFAULT)
  rake generate_artifacts
b) (with SNAPSHOT jars)
  rake generate_artifacts AXIS_VERSION=SNAPSHOT

4) run the tests:
